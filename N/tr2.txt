First Slide:
Hi everyone, I'm really glad to have this opportunity to share my recent work with you.

Second Slide:
To start, let me give you a brief history of the problem that inspired this work.

In 1979, Frankl proposed a very interesting conjecture. He stated that for every union-closed family, there exists a member that appears in at least half of the family.

At first glance, this seems obvious, yet the problem remains unsolved after more than four decades.

Here, you can see the formal statement of the conjecture:

K^i represents all members of the family that contain i as an element.

Third Slide:
Here, you can see two small examples.
You can easily verify the conjecture for these cases.

Fourth Slide:
One day, while I was thinking about the conjecture, two interesting questions came to my mind:

I asked myself: if we have a union-closed (UC) family and know that it satisfies Frankl's conjecture, what can we say about its isomorphic counterpart?
More generally, suppose we have two UC families. Does every member in one family have a corresponding member in its isomorphic counterpart with the same frequency count?
Here, you can see the formal definition of isomorphism between two UC families:
An isomorphism is a bijective function that preserves unions.

Fifth Slide:
Regarding the first question, we don’t know the answer yet. However, if Frankl's conjecture is proven true, then it automatically follows that the answer is "yes."

Regarding the first question, we don’t have a definitive answer yet. However, if the Union-Closed Set Conjecture is confirmed to be true, then the answer would automatically be yes (or positive), because the conjecture states that every union-closed family must have this property.


For the second question, upon examination, we quickly realize that it is not true—even in simple cases.

As you can see in this example, there is a member that appears four times in K_1, but we do not have any member with the same frequency in K_2.

Sixth Slide:
However, if we take a closer look at this example, we see that the statement is true for some members!

Seventh Slide:
Additionally, if we examine their lattice structures, we see that they comply in the same way, and our isomorphic mapping is actually an isomorphism between their lattices.

Furthermore, when we remove all members except those with the same frequency, we find that they look exactly the same—just with relabeled members.

By putting these observations together, we gain an important insight that motivates us to investigate the second question more closely.

To continue working on the question, we first need a definition that helps us distinguish between core elements and those that are redundant.

Eighth Slide:
We can formalize this insight with a simple yet powerful definition of redundant elements:

We call an element redundant if removing it from each member of the family does not affect the cardinality of the family.

This simple definition keeps the overall structure intact.

Now, we can remove all redundant elements to reach a pure UC family—one without any redundant elements.

Here is the formal definition of a pure union-closed family.

This definition is very interesting because, while keeping the overall structure unchanged, it allows us to work with a cleaner family.

Moreover, it is easy to verify that Frankl’s conjecture holds if and only if it holds for pure union-closed families. This means that whenever we study a union-closed family, we can assume it is pure.

Ninth Slide:
Now, let's revisit our two previous questions.

When restricted to pure union-closed families, the answer to both questions is yes.

In fact, if the answer to the second question is "yes," then the answer to the first follows as a corollary.

Thus, our main task is to verify the second question in the general case.

Tenth Slide:
To verify the second question, we use a very useful theorem, which was proved as part of this work.

It states that the cardinality of all members is preserved under isomorphism.

When I began working on this problem, I did not expect such a strong result.

Initially, I was only trying to prove that the number of non-redundant elements remains the same in both families. Now, we have that as a corollary of this theorem.

Eleventh Slide:
With the cardinality theorem, we can conclude that all main operations are preserved under isomorphism, including:

Union
Intersection
Set difference
Complement
Twelfth Slide:
This strong corollary helps us prove the main theorem of this work.

It states that isomorphism in union-closed families is actually induced by a specific map, which we call hyperisomorphism between family universes.

This theorem answers our original questions.
