Isomorphisms in Union-Closed Families

Abstract:
The study of union-closed families of sets is closely linked to a fundamental open question in combinatorics: Franklâ€™s Union-Closed Conjecture. Proposed in 1979, the conjecture states that in every non-empty union-closed family, there exists an element that appears in at least half of the sets.

In this talk, we examine the structural properties of union-closed families and explore how these structures are preserved through isomorphisms. Specifically, we show that the core structure of a union-closed family remains completely intact under an isomorphism by proving that such an isomorphism is induced by a map known as a hyperisomorphism. This perspective provides a new approach to understanding the intrinsic structure of these families and may offer insights into longstanding conjectures in the field.
