📜 Refined Talk Transcript
Hi everyone, I’m really glad to have this opportunity to share my recent work with you today.

To begin, let’s take a look at the history behind the problem that motivated this research.

In 1979, Péter Frankl proposed a famous conjecture about finite union-closed families. He claimed that in every such family, there exists an element that appears in at least half of the sets.

At first glance, this might seem like an obvious statement. But despite over four decades of research, the conjecture remains unsolved.

Here are some simple examples where the conjecture holds. In these cases, we can clearly identify elements appearing in at least half the sets.

However, proving it for all union-closed families has turned out to be extremely difficult.

Why I Took a Different Approach
Instead of tackling the conjecture head-on, my goal in this work was to deepen our understanding of union-closed families from a structural perspective.

Specifically, I asked:
👉 How much of the core structure of a union-closed family is preserved under isomorphism?

Here is the formal definition of isomorphism, along with some examples to illustrate it.

The Key Question That Sparked This Work
One day, while thinking about the problem, I asked myself:

💡 If a union-closed family satisfies Frankl’s conjecture, does every isomorphic family also satisfy it?

In other words:

If one family has an element appearing in at least half the sets, does its isomorphic counterpart also have such an element?
More generally, if an element appears in 11 sets in one family, must there be an element appearing in 11 sets in its isomorphic version?
When I started testing examples, I quickly realized:

🚫 It’s not always true! Even In simple cases.

Here are some counterexamples showing that isomorphic families don’t necessarily preserve frequency counts in this way.

A New Perspective: Structural Preservation
However, a deeper look at these examples revealed something interesting:

🔍 Even if individual element frequencies don’t transfer exactly, the overall structure of the family is completely preserved.

In fact, if we draw the Hasse diagrams of two isomorphic union-closed families, we see that their lattice structure remains identical.

This raised a natural next question:

💡 What about the elements that actually “shape” the family?
💡 Can we separate the “core” structure from unnecessary noise?

Key Idea: Redundant Elements & Pure Families
To formalize this idea, we first need to distinguish essential elements from unnecessary ones.

👉 We define redundant elements as elements that can be removed without changing the structure of the family.

Here is the formal definition of redundant elements, along with an example.

Surprisingly, not only does the core structure remain intact after removing redundant elements, but the isomorphism itself is preserved.

This naturally leads to another question:
👉 What happens when we work only with “pure” union-closed families—those that contain no redundant elements?

Main Result: The Cardinality Theorem & Main Theorem
Once we eliminate redundant elements, something interesting happens:

👉 The property we were testing earlier actually holds in these pure families.

This is our main theorem—showing that for pure union-closed families, the structural preservation under isomorphism is even stronger.

But to prove this, we needed another key result:
👉 The Cardinality Theorem, which shows how element distributions behave under isomorphism.

Here is the formal statement of the Cardinality Theorem, which plays a crucial role in proving our main result.

Final Thoughts & What’s Next?
When I first started working on this, I didn’t expect all structural properties to be preserved under isomorphism.

My initial goal was only to show that the total number of elements remains unchanged. But as I refined the proof, it became clear that the preservation extended far beyond that, leading to the stronger results we now have.

Moving forward, an important question is:
👉 Can these structural results give us new insights toward proving Frankl’s conjecture?

This remains an open direction, and I hope these ideas will contribute to a better understanding of union-closed families.

Thank you for your attention! I’d be happy to take any questions now, or feel free to reach out to me later.
